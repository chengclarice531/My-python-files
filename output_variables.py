x = 'Python is awesome'
print(x)

#Multiple variables
x = 'Python'
y = 'is'
z = 'awesome'
print(x, y, z)

#using different operator
#Notice the space
x = 'Python '
y = 'is '
z = 'awesome'
print(x + y + z)

#Mathematical operator
x = 5
y = 10
print(x + y)

#cannot use plus to combine string and number
#the best way is to use commas which support different data types
